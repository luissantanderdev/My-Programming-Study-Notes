    "The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) are two distinct principles in object-oriented design, but they are related and often work together.\n",

    "   - **Focus:** The OCP emphasizes that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Encourages the design of systems that can be easily extended with new functionalities without modifying existing code.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Achieved by using abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism to allow adding new features through subclassing without changing existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**\n",
    "   - **Focus:** The LSP emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting program correctness.\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Ensures that derived classes (subclasses) can be used interchangeably with their base classes (superclasses) without introducing errors.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Demonstrated by creating subclasses that adhere to the behavior expected by the superclass. Subclasses should extend, not override or contradict, the behavior of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "- **Scope:**\n",
    "  - OCP is primarily concerned with the extensibility of a class or system by allowing new features to be added through extensions.\n",
    "  - LSP is concerned with the interchangeability of objects, ensuring that subclasses can be used wherever their superclass is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nature of Change:**\n",
    "  - OCP deals with changes in functionality and encourages adding new features.\n",
    "  - LSP deals with changes in behavior and ensures that subclass behavior is consistent with the expectations of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation:**\n",
    "  - OCP is often implemented using abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.\n",
    "  - LSP is implemented by adhering to the behavioral contract established by the superclass when creating subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, these principles often complement each other. Following both principles helps create flexible, maintainable, and robust object-oriented systems. The OCP allows for easy extension, and the LSP ensures that extended classes can seamlessly replace their base classes."
