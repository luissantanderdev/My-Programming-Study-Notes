    "- [Dynamic data structures] - they can aquire memory at run-time without resizing the data structure.\n",
    "- [Grow Data Structure Organically] - no problem if we do not know the number of items we want to store at compile time.\n",
    "- [Can store diffrent Sized Items] - arrays on the other hand assume the items have the exact same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- [More Memory] - linked lists need more memory than arrays because we have to store the references.\n",
    "- [No Random Access] - there are no indexes - we can access the first node (head node) exclusively.\n",
    "- [Can Not Go Backwards] - how to access the previous item?\n",
    "- [Not Predictable] - Running time of the application depends on what operations the users do. "
