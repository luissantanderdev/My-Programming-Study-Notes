    "- it is another data structure - so the aim is to be able to store items efficiently (insertion and removal operations)\n",
    "- arrays have a huge disadvantage there may be holes in the data structure and we have to shift a lot of items.\n",
    "- this problem can be elimiated by linked lists.\n",
    "- every node stores the data itself and a reference to the next node in the linked list data structure.\n",
    "- this is why linked lists need more memory than arrays.\n",
    "- the items are not stored next to each other in memory - so there is no random indexing.\n",
    "- we can implement more complex data structures and abstract data types such as stacks and queues."
