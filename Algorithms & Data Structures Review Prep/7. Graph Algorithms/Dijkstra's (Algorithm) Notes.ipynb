    "### History\n",
    "- can handle positive edge weights - bellman ford but can have negative weights as well.\n",
    "- it can find the shortest path in a G(V,E) graph from v to u but it is able to construct a shortest path tree as well.\n",
    "- the shortest path tree defines the shortest pathts from a source to all the other nodes.\n",
    "- it is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Time \n",
    "- has O(V*log*V + E) running time complexity.\n",
    "- it is a greedy approach - it tries to find the global optimum with the help of local optimum.\n",
    "- on every iteration we want to find the minimum distance to the next vertex possible.\n",
    "- the approach data structure is a priority queue (heap)."
