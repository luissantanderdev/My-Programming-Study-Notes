    "* We have a G(V,E) graph and we want to visit all the V vertices - we can do it with breadth-first-search.\n",
    "* The algorithm keeps visiting the nodes and then the neighbors of these nodes.\n",
    "* O(V + E) running time complexity.\n",
    "* The memory complexity of this approach is not favorable as we have to store a lot of references.\n",
    "* Advantage is that we can construct the shortest-path essentially Dijkstra's algorithm does a breadth-first search if all edge weights are 1."
