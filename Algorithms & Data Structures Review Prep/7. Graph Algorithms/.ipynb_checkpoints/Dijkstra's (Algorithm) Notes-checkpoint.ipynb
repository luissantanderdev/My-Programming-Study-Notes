    "### History\n",
    "- can handle positive edge weights - bellman ford but can have negative weights as well.\n",
    "- it can find the shortest path in a G(V,E) graph from v to u but it is able to construct a shortest path tree as well.\n",
    "- the shortest path tree defines the shortest pathts from a source to all the other nodes.\n",
    "- it is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Time \n",
    "- has O(V*log*V + E) running time complexity.\n",
    "- it is a greedy approach - it tries to find the global optimum with the help of local optimum.\n",
    "- on every iteration we want to find the minimum distance to the next vertex possible.\n",
    "- the approach data structure is a priority queue (heap)."

    "- each node calculates the distances between itself and all other nodes and stores this information as a table.\n",
    "- each node sends its table to all adjacent nodes.\n",
    "- when a node receives distance tables from its neighbours it calculates the shortest routes to all other nodes and updates its own table to reflect any changes.\n",

    "- it is important to make sure the image will not deform.\n",
    "- we have to elimate the least signficant bit strings.\n",
    "- construct a so-called energy function - and remove connected string of pixels containing the least energy.\n",
    "- Photoshop and GIMP use this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- we build a huge graph: vertices are the pixels and the edges are pointing from every vertex to it's downward 3 neighbours.\n",
    "- the ***energy function*** determines the edge weights.\n",
    "- we can use topological order shortest path to find the string of pixels to be removed. "
