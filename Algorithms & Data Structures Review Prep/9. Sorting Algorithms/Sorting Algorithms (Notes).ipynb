    "* a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of an array (or list) in a certain order.\n",
    "* when sorting numerical data it is called numerical ordering.\n",
    "* if we are after the sorted order of string sor characters - it is called alphabetical ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * comparison based sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort or quicksort)\n",
    "  * if nums[i] < nums[j]: swap items\n",
    " \n",
    "  * non-comparison based sorting algorithms: (bucket sort and radix sort).\n",
    " \n",
    "* For sorting N items: we have to make log2N! comparisons with Stirling-formula it can be reduced to NLogN\n",
    "  * so the theta(n * Log * N) time complexity is the lower bound for comparison based sorting algorithms.\n",
    "  * ok we can achive O(N) running time as far as sorting is concerned such as bucket sort or radix sort.\n",
    " \n",
    "We can classify comparison based sorting algorithms based on their running time (how fast they are).\n",

    "1.) In-Place: a sorting algorithm is called in-place if it does not need any additional memory - it needs O(1) additional memory beyond the items being sorted. \n",
    "  * does not need to allocate extra memory for the sorting algorithm.\n",
    "  * quicksort, insertion sort, selection sort are in place algorithms but merge sort is not.\n",
    "  * we prefer in-place algorithms because they are memory efficient.\n",

    "2.) Recursive: a sorting algorithm may be implemented with recursion (the divide-and-conquer approaches) or without recursion.\n",
    "  * most of the sorting algorithms are not recursive (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort...)\n",
