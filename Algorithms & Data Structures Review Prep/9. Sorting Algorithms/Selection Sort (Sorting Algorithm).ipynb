    "# Selection Sort (Sorting Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "* selection sort is another O(N^2) quadratic running time sorting algorithm.\n",
    "* it is noted for it's simplicity and it has performance advantages over the more complicated algorithms.\n",
    "* particularly important and useful when auxiliary memory is limited.\n",
    "* the algorithm divides the original array into 2 parts: items already sorted and the items that are not yet sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the main idea is linear search: we can find the smallest (largest) item in O(N) linear running time complexity.\n",
    "* then swap the item with the leftmost item in the array - that is not yet sorted of course.\n",
    "* we have to make linear search for N-1 items this is why the final running time complexity is O(N^2).\n",
    "* it is in-place so it does not need additional memory.\n",
    "* selection sort is not a stable sorting algorithm.\n",
    "* selection sort always outperforms bubble sort. "

    "### Speed Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "* selection sort and insertion sort are rather slow approaches - but they are faster with small arrays (5-10 items).\n",
    "* this is why the fast sorting approaches use selection sort and insertion sort when the number of items is < 10.\n",
    "* it makes less writes than insertion sort - it is crucial when writes are significantly more expensive than reads.\n",
    "* important with EEPROM and flash memory where every write lessens the lifespan of the memory."
